            <p>I began my career as an intern and later continued on a contract basis until the end of December, working as a frontend developer on loan to OPAP S.A.â€”a leading Greek company in games of chance and more, headquartered in Athens.
                During my time at OPAP, I worked extensively with Vue.js to improve existing websites, develop new applications, and contribute to large-scale projects. Notably, I was involved in the expansion of the main site, which integrated three additional games. I collaborated with a large team in two-week sprints, managing tasks in Jira, and gained experience in creating unit tests using Bamboo and Azure.
                In my last two years at OPAP, I was entrusted with developing new pages and handling solo projects from start to finish.
